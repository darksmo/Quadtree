Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
libquadtree is a fast implementation of a quadtree datastructure, optimized for
AMD64.

Building & Installing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To install locally and test:
   1) Change into the source directory:
      $ cd libquadtree-1.1/

   2) Configure the library for your system:
      $ ./configure --prefix=$PWD/testdir

   3) Build the library
      $ make

   4) Install into the $PWD/testdir:
      $ make install

   5) Run tests to ensure that it works:
      $ make check

To install in a production environment:
   1) Configure the library:
      $ cd libquadtree-1.1/
      $ ./configure

   2) Compile with asserts disabled and maximum optimizations
      $ make clean all CFLAGS="-DNDEBUG -O3"

   3) Install with debugging symbols stripped
      $ make install-strip

   The default prefix for installation is `/usr', but can be overrided by
   passing the `--prefix=/absolute/path/' to the configure script.


See the INSTALL file for detailed but generic instructions of how to use more
advanced features of the build system.
