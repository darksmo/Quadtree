	* docs/libquadtree.texi: Wrote texinfo documentation currently only as
	detailed as the manpage, but with room for additions. This automatically
	gives us PDF/PS/DVI/info/HTML documentation.
	* docs/libquadtree.3: Wrote a full manpage for libquadtree
	* README.maintainer: Added new notes about documentation.

	* configure.ac: Added portability checks for unsigned long long and its

	* src/quadtree_portable.h: Added new header that defines PRIu64 for portably
	printing u_int64_t types.
	* src/quadtree.c: Fixed several compiler warnings relating to printing
	u_int64_t values, comparing unsigned with signed, and printing size_t
	values.
	* src/quadtree.h, src/quadtree_private.h: Fixed warnings here too.
	* src/tests/benchmark.c, src/tests/check.c: Fixed warnings here too.
