# This file should be used for ignoring files throughout the entire project,
# files in this directory, and standard autotools generated files. Patterns for
# single files in a subdirectory should be done in the .gitignore for that
# subdirectory (unless they are generated by autotools files in this
# directory.)
#
# Notes:
#   - Patterns with a leading '/' apply to this directory only
#   - Patterns without a leading '/' apply to every subdirectory recursively
