The following targets can be used as 'make [target]'.

Building and Installing:
  all            - Build libquadtree normally
  install        - Install the library, header file and manpage
  install-strip  - Same as above, but strip debugging symbols from the library

Cleaning and Uninstalling:
  uninstall      - Uninstall previously installed files
  clean          - Remove files generated by make
  distclean      - Remove files generated by ./configure

Distributing:
  dist           - Create distributions with default archive formats
  dist-gzip2     - Create a tidy '.tar.gz' distribution
  dist-bzip2     - Create a tidy '.tar.bz2' distribution
  dist-zip       - Create a tidy '.zip' distribution
  dist-lzma      - Create a tidy '.tar.lzma' distribution
  dist-xz        - Create a tidy '.tar.xz' distribution
  dist-shar      - Create a tidy '.shar.gz' shell archive distribution

Testing:
  check          - Run tests to confirm the library is working
  distcheck      - Test if `make dist` produces correct distributions

Examples:
   1) Install debugging-enabled  version into /usr
         $ ./configure && make && make install
   2) Building for a custom production environment:
         $ ./configure --prefix=/absolute/path/to/install/into/
         $ make clean all CFLAGS="-DNDEBUG -O3"
         $ make install-strip

For more information, consult the ./INSTALL and ./README files.
